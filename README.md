# React Chat App

## Project Overview

This is a React-based chat application that simulates a messaging interface. It features a sidebar with a list of chats, a main chat window, and various interactive elements such as message input, image sharing, and quick replies.

## Setup and Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

For production:

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Serve the built files: `npm run preview`

## Key Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### State Management

I chose to use React's built-in hooks (useState, useContext) for state management. This decision was made because:

- The application's state is relatively simple and doesn't require a complex state management solution.
- Built-in hooks provide a lightweight and easy-to-understand solution for our needs.

Trade-off: While this approach works well for our current needs, it may become harder to manage as the application grows. In the future, we might consider adopting a more robust state management solution like Redux or MobX.

### Styling Solution

I used styled-components for CSS-in-JS styling. This choice was made because:

- It allows for component-scoped styling, reducing the risk of style conflicts.
- It provides a seamless integration with React components.
- It supports dynamic styling based on props, which is useful for our theming needs.

Trade-off: While styled-components offers great flexibility, it may have a slight performance overhead compared to traditional CSS. However, for our application, the benefits outweigh this minor drawback.

## Third-Party Libraries Used

- Vite: Fast build tool and development server.
- react-icons: Provides a wide range of icons as React components.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

This project was challenging because I didn't have much experience with TypeScript, styled-components, Jest, and React Testing Library. I had used similar tools like Tailwind and Vitest before, but learning this new set of technologies was still difficult. To solve these problems, I read a lot of official guides and online tutorials. I also used AI coding tools to help me with code writing and best practices. These tools were very helpful in learning quickly and filling in the gaps in my knowledge.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement real-time messaging using WebSockets.
2. Add user authentication and profile management.
3. Implement end-to-end encryption for messages.
4. Improve accessibility features for users with disabilities.
5. Implement dark mode and different themes.
